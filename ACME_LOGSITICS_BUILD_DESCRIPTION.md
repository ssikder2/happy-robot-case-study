## Executive Summary

This document outlines the development of a comprehensive automated inbound carrier sales system designed specifically for ACME LOGISTICS. The solution leverages HappyRobot's AI platform to create an intelligent voice agent that handles carrier inquiries, verifies credentials, searches for suitable loads, negotiates rates, and provides real-time analytics through a custom dashboard.

## System Overview

### Core Components

2. **Load Search API** - Custom FastAPI backend for load matching
3. **Carrier Verification** - FMCSA API integration for credential validation
4. **Analytics Dashboard** - Real-time metrics and call tracking
5. **Rate Negotiation Engine** - Automated pricing and counter-offer system

### Technology Stack
- **AI Platform:** HappyRobot (Voice AI Agent)
- **Backend API:** FastAPI (Python)
- **Database:** In-memory storage with production-ready architecture
- **Deployment:** Fly.io (Docker + HTTPS)
- **External APIs:** FMCSA carrier verification
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JavaScript dashboard

## Detailed System Architecture

### 1. Inbound Voice Agent Flow

The HappyRobot AI agent follows a structured conversation flow:

#### **General Prompt & Context**
- Professional freight broker persona
- ACME LOGISTICS branding and expertise
- Industry-specific terminology and processes
- Clear conversation objectives and guardrails

#### **Call Processing Workflow**

**Step 1: Initial Greeting & Information Gathering**
- Warm, professional greeting
- Company introduction (ACME LOGISTICS)
- Carrier information collection (MC number, equipment type, preferences)

**Step 2: Carrier Verification**
- **Tool:** Verify Carrier
- **Method:** FMCSA API integration
- **Endpoint:** `GET /carriers/docket-number/{docketNumber}`
- **Validation:** MC number, DOT number, operating status
- **Fallback:** Professional handling of verification failures

**Step 3: Load Search & Matching**
- **Tool:** Search for Loads
- **Method:** Custom API integration
- **Endpoint:** `POST https://freight-api-happy-robot.fly.dev/search-loads`
- **Criteria:** Origin, destination, equipment type, pickup date
- **Matching Logic:** Intelligent load-to-carrier matching

**Step 4: Load Presentation & Negotiation**
- **Tool:** Present Loads and Negotiate
- **Features:**
  - Professional load presentation
  - Rate negotiation with 5-10 second "system checking" delays
  - Multiple negotiation rounds (up to 3)
  - Dynamic rate calculations with $100-150 buffer
  - Professional resistance to low offers

**Step 5: Call Resolution**
- **Successful Booking:** Transfer to sales team
- **No Agreement:** Professional call conclusion
- **Verification Failed:** Alternative contact options

### 2. Load Search API

#### **Endpoint Specifications**
```
POST https://freight-api-happy-robot.fly.dev/search-loads
Authorization: Bearer [API_KEY]
Content-Type: application/json

Request Body:
{
  "origin_city": "Chicago",
  "origin_state": "IL", 
  "destination_city": "Dallas",
  "destination_state": "TX",
  "equipment_type": "Dry Van",
  "pickup_datetime": "2025-09-17T08:00:00Z"
}
```

#### **Response Format**
```json
{
  "loads": [
    {
      "load_id": "L001",
      "origin": "Chicago, IL",
      "destination": "Dallas, TX", 
      "equipment_type": "Dry Van",
      "pickup_date": "2025-09-17",
      "loadboard_rate": 2500
    }
  ],
  "load_count": 1,
  "selected_load_id": "L001",
  "initial_rate": 2500
}
```

### 3. Carrier Verification System

#### **FMCSA Integration**
- Real-time carrier verification
- MC number validation
- DOT number cross-reference
- Operating status confirmation
- Error handling and fallback procedures

#### **Verification Outcomes**
- **Success:** Proceed to load search
- **Failure:** Professional explanation and alternative options
- **No Transfer:** Maintain professional relationship

### 4. Rate Negotiation Engine

#### **Negotiation Strategy**
- Start with loadboard rate
- 5-10 second "system checking" delays
- Maximum 3 negotiation rounds
- 10%+ buffer for counter-offers
- Professional resistance to low rates

#### **Rate Calculation Logic**
```
Initial Rate = Loadboard Rate
Counter Offer = Initial Rate + Buffer (Intial Rate + 10%)
Final Rate = Negotiated Amount
```

### 5. Analytics Dashboard

#### **Real-Time Metrics**
- **Total Calls:** Complete call volume tracking
- **Booking Success Rate:** Percentage of successful bookings
- **Call Outcomes:** Detailed classification system
- **Recent Activity:** Live call monitoring

#### **Call Classification System**
